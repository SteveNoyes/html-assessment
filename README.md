## My process

### Built with

- HTML1

- CSS 

### Useful resources

- [Irregular Table Headings](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/irregular/) - table heading that spans multiple rows while still contained

- [text spacing](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_text_spacing.asp) - Spacing for the top header was made easier with this.

- [realtive width percentage](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_table_sizes.asp) - table relative sizing

- [meta data](https://www.goodemailcode.com/email-code/template.html) - email meta data 

### Testing

- [caniemail](https://www.caniemail.com/) - easy reference for testing and troubleshooting

- [CSS Browser Compatibility](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/) - turns stylesheet in head into inline css. Much easier than writing inline css.

- [test for browser inconsistencies](https://www.htmlemailcheck.com/check/) - check for common mistakes and browser inconsistencies.
